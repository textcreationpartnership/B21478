            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>To the Right Honourable GEORGE Earl of <hi>Berkeley,</hi> Viſcount <hi>Durſely,</hi> Lord <hi>Berkeley</hi> of <hi>Berkeley-Caſtle,</hi> &amp;c.</head>

               <salute>My LORD,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>IT was one of the moſt prudent Actions of <hi>Virgil</hi>'s Life, to beſtow the fruits of his admired Genius, and proſtrate the Labours of his Honoured Muſe at the feet of a more Honoured, Witty, and Learned Patron; for <hi>Mecaenas</hi> was a Man of an unbiaſs'd, impartial, and generous nature; and knew as well how to Judge and Applaud an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Poem, as the Poet himſelf knew how to write what was fit to be Applauded.</p>
            <p>This therefore cauſes our Modern Authors (inſtructed by his Wife Example) to make an humble offering of their Works to the moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving and knowing Men of the Age; cunningly implying, That as they have moſt Wit and Judgment to find out their faults, they have alſo moſt modeſty and good nature to excuſe 'em.</p>
            <p>Amongſt this tribe, my Lord, I muſt humbly confeſs my ſelf one, and acknowledge theſe two Reaſons for my preſumption: Firſt, A ſecret pride to have my Play grac'd with the great Name of the Honoured <hi>Berkeley,</hi> lineally deſcended (for many Ages paſt) from the Royal Blood of the Illuſtrious <hi>Harding;</hi> and thence flowing through the veins of One and twenty Noble Families, to the Honours he now deſervedly wears, and which his Sacred Majeſty could not more juſtly beſtow. And, ſecondly, to be impartially Judg'd, by a perſon who knows as well how to write, as to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>atronize.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:199240:3"/>
            <p>Your Lordſhip did me once the favour to preſent me a little book of your own Writing, Entituled, <hi>Hiſtorical Applications,</hi> &amp;c. where he that reads may find an exact ſerenity of Fancy, a vivacity of Wit, a refin'd Elegance in Language, and obſerve it to be adorn'd with certain Jems of Morality and Divinity, and other maxims of Rational Wiſdom, and true Collections of Hiſtory, that render it a piece fit to be admired by the moſt Wife and Learned, and lov'd by the moſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious and Loyal.</p>
            <p>I make this little digreſſion my Lord, not out of any inſolent belief, that I am fit to commend either the Book, or its Author, for that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to a far better Genius and Pen, but only out of an impatient de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to do my ſelf Juſtice in applauding you, though 'tis impoſſible I ſhould do you any.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sola virtus vera Nobilitas,</hi> is a Maxim in which <hi>Seneca</hi> and your Lordſhip fully agree; for would any man be Pious and Morally good, let him make you his pattern; would he be bleſs'd with a ſweet, benign, and modeſt diſpoſition, and ſhow a perfect Character of true Nobility, unſway'd by the powerful vices, Pride and Folly, let him make you his pattern; Or would he be loyal and honeſt, a faithful lover of his King, and an unmovable Pillar of his Country, ſtill let him Copy you, and make your Actions his Examples, you that had rather be Juſt than Popular; and had rather follow the dictates of a good conſcience, than gain the ſervice and applauſe of a numerous and potent party.</p>
            <p>This, my Lord, is ſo great and undoubted a Truth, that with the moſt nice apprehenſions 'tis impoſſible it ſhould leave the leaſt impreſſion of flattery; that being a thing as difficult for me to do, as for you to endure; for all that know ye will ſay thus much; and therefore 'tis probable all that love ye will ſpeak much more.</p>
            <p>As to this Comedy, it had the Honour to pleaſe one party; and I am only glad, that the St. <hi>Georges</hi> of Eighty-one got a Victory over the old hiſſing Dragons of Forty-two; 'tis a good Omen, and I hope portends future ſucceſſes, though ſome fat <hi>Whiggs</hi> of Sir <hi>Barnaby</hi>'s tribe made all the intereſt they could to cry it down.</p>
            <p>My Lord, 'tis not only a nice, but a very difficult thing to write a good Comedy, and therefore a tolerable one ſhould be the more excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſable; for there is not only Wit, but Plot, Invention, and a quick and ingenious fancy requir'd: Fancy! the brighteſt Jewel of Poetry, of which the Famous <hi>Engliſh Spencer</hi> was the great and only Maſter,
<pb facs="tcp:199240:3"/> as we may ſee in all his Deſcriptions, but more particularly in his Legend of Temperance, when he ſpeaks of <hi>Mammon</hi> or <hi>Covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</hi>

                  <l>Of which ſome were rude Ore not purified</l>
                  <l>Of <hi>Mulciber</hi>'s devouring Element.</l>
                  <l>Some others were new driven, and diſtent</l>

               </lg>
            </q>
            <p>But this is a ſort of Poetry of a different nature from <hi>Drama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks;</hi> and therefore the fancy muſt of neceſſity vary, becauſe in one it is digeſted into Characters, that are to ſpeak before a carping Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience: and in the other, perhaps, only to be read or ſpoken of before one or two perſons. But ſuppoſe the fancy to be good, that will not now ſerve turn; for in this Age 'tis not a Poets Merit, but his Party that muſt do his buſineſs; ſo that if his Play conſiſts of a Witch, a Devil, or a Broomſtick, ſo he have but a Prieſt at one end of the Play, and a Faction at 'tother end of the Pit, it ſhall be fam'd for an excellent piece. And the <hi>Mobile</hi> either encouraged by their <hi>Grandees,</hi> or treated by the Poet, ſhall throng to it with as much zeal, as they once
<pb facs="tcp:199240:4"/> did to the Committee, when the ſcale was turn'd, and Loyalty began to come in faſhion.</p>
            <p>This, my Lord, is the World, and the Worlds Nature; but you, I may boldly ſay, value Merit for its own ſake, and not through intereſt, or to pleaſe a faction, you will not hiſs or clap a Play in the wrong place, nor uſe an Arbitrary Power to carry a Cauſe by Popular Interest or Parties: I ſay you will not do this, and I wiſh all others were of your mind. But ſince they are not, your Lordſhips acceptance and patronizing of this Comedy, is the greateſt Encouragement and Honour that can poſſibly happen to,</p>

                     <p>Love it! oh extremely in a cold froſty morning, when a man has been at a true Debauch the night before: I hold it to be the only neceſſary Diverſion: Dancing, Madam! why 'tis the very glowing-brand of Luxury that kindles the temperate blood, heats and fires us till we are fit for the Modiſh buſineſs 'twas deſign'd for: Then think not but I doat on it moſt violently.</p>

                     <p>He tells me ſo, Sir, and for whoſe ſake he has ingag'd you to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs to his wife.</p>

My <hi>May</hi> of blood would give my cheeks a bluſh, greater than would appear on proof of Infamy, did he but know I had an Imperfection. And am I ſlighted thus? thus left — ſold to another, and by my husband too — whom I have lov'd — far, far beyond his merit. Teach me then, ye Powers, Revenge, and Jealouſie in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct an injur'd woman: 'Tis done — <hi>Townly</hi> ſhall be the man; I'le inſtantly write to him, and let looſe all my Charms to retrieve him from <hi>Livia.</hi> Then ſhall my husband find too late, that Marriage ſhould have a reliſh of Love, as well as Duty.</p>
